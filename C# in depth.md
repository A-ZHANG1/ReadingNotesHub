            - `delegate`:
            - **类型安全**的对象，函数指针（存储方法的地址）。
            - 用于定义对具有特定方法签名的方法的引用。可以指向一个或多个方法(多播)。
            - 声明: `delegate 返回值类型 委托名(参数列表)`
            - 内置委托类型
                ```csharp
                Action<T> // 没有返回值的方法，0 ~ 16入参
                Func<T, TResult> //有返回值的方法， TResult是返回值类型
                Predicate<T> //表示返回布尔值的方法，1个入参
